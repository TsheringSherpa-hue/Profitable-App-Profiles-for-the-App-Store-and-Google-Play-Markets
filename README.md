# Profitable-App-Profiles-for-the-App-Store-and-Google-Play-Markets
The aim of this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. We are only interested in apps that are free to download and install. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help the developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.
